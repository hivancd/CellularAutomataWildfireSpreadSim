# Fire Spread Simulation using CA
## Simulation project for UH course 2024

To Run the simulation you should open the project with Godot and open the main.tscn scene and run it.

It simulates a forest fire using cellular automata, where two teams, A and B, are stationed at specific locations and possess a "firefighting force" of firefighters responsible for extinguishing the flames ignited by the opposing team. The objective is to burn the entire terrain of the opposing team while simultaneously extinguishing the fires on one's own terrain. The team with the most unburned terrain at the end of the time limit wins.
The parameters are passed through text for NLP processing. The search modality will focus on determining the optimal location for each firefighter to extinguish the fire in real-time and the knowledge will be based on known firefighting strategies and the map of the area.
